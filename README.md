# SIFTFlannImageAlign
This is program on python that uses SIFT features and Flann knn matching to align together a lot of images. I used this program to align images of my colleges that I did every day in one year. Program have some optimisation. It stores key points of good images. It tries to match image with previosly succesfuly matched image etc. 

#Usage
You can use some smart

git clone https://github.com/Den-Industries/SIFTFlannImageAlign SIFTFlannImageAlign

but I think you just better to open file and make ctrl + c ctrl + v to your project
Don't forget to install opencv by
```shell
pip3 install opencv-python
```
Good luck!
