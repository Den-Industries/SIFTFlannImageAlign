# SIFTFlannImageAlign
This is program on python that uses SIFT features and Flann knn matching to align together a lot of images. I used this program to align images of my colleges that I did every day in one year. Program have some optimisation. It stores key points of good images. It tries to match image with previosly succesfuly matched image etc. Good luck!
